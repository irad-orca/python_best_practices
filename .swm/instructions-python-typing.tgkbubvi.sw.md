title: Instructions - Python Typing
---
Python `typing` was introduced in Python 3.5. It provides runtime support for type hints.

Type hints are great - they help catch certain errors, and help you build and maintain a cleaner architecture.

To run through the Typing exercises:

1. Go through the <SwmLink doc-title="Instructions - Python Best Practices">[Instructions - Python Best Practices](/.swm/instructions-python-best-practices.jo0qbkzz.sw.md)</SwmLink> document if you haven't already. The instructions are similar.
2. The exercises are found under <SwmPath>[python_typing/exercises/](/python_typing/exercises/)</SwmPath> and the corresponding solutions are under <SwmPath>[python_typing/solutions/](/python_typing/solutions/)</SwmPath>
3. To run tests for each exercise, run `mypy --strict <filename>`. For example, for the first exercise, run `mypy --strict 01_ret_str.py`.
4. Again, we highly recommend you go through each solution after you finish the exercise as it includes additional information.

Good luck, and have fun!
