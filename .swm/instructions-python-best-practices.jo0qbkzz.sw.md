# What is this repo about?

This repo should help you master Python in a hands-on manner, brought to you by [Swimm.io](https://swimm.io).

The repo consists of hands-on, bite-sized exercises covering best-practices in Python (from basics to advanced), as well as specific modules or libraries (e.g., `typing`).

This is a public repo maintinaed by [Swimm](https://swimm.io).

&nbsp;

# Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge.
- Have `python3` in your path launch Python with a version `>=3.8`. That is, you should be able to launch `python3` from the terminal.
- Install [Swimm's IDE extension](https://docs.swimm.io/ide-integrations/).

## Exercise structure

Before you take your first few steps it's important to set our expectations:

- The exercises for Python Best Practices are found under <SwmPath>[python_best_practices/](/python_best_practices/)</SwmPath> folder. For example, There, you have the folder <SwmPath>[python_best_practices/exercises/](/python_best_practices/exercises/)</SwmPath>  for exercises. The exercises are ordered so go through them according to the filename - that is, start with <SwmPath>[python_best_practices/exercises/01_last_element.py](/python_best_practices/exercises/01_last_element.py)</SwmPath>, continue to <SwmPath>[python_best_practices/exercises/02_reverse.py](/python_best_practices/exercises/02_reverse.py)</SwmPath> and so on.
- In each exercise - you will have some code to complete.
- To **test yourself**, run `python3 -m doctest <file_name>`. For example, for the first exercise, run:`python3 -m doctest 01_last_element.py`.
- The **technical specifications** of what you need to achieve will be written as docstrings inside the **code itself**.
- At times, we would offer some *"Recommended References"* that will help you solve each specific challenge. We encourage you to search online and dive deeper on your own!
- After you complete each exercise, it is highly recommended to review the corresponding solution in the <SwmPath>[python_best_practices/solutions/](/python_best_practices/solutions/)</SwmPath> directory. For example - the solution for <SwmPath>[python_best_practices/exercises/01_last_element.py](/python_best_practices/exercises/01_last_element.py)</SwmPath> is in <SwmPath>[python_best_practices/solutions/01_last_element.py](/python_best_practices/solutions/01_last_element.py)</SwmPath>. The solution will show you a way to approach the exercise that might be different than yours, and at times - provide additional pointers.

Have fun and good luck!
