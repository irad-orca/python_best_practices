# What is this repo about?

This repo should help you master Python in a hands-on manner, brought to you by [Swimm.io](https://swimm.io). 

The repo consists of hands-on, bite-sized exercises covering best-practices in Python (from basics to advanced), as well as specific modules or libraries (e.g., `typing`).

This is a public repo maintinaed by [Swimm](https://swimm.io).

# Prerequisites

* Basic Python knowledge.
* Have `python3` in your path launch Python with a version `>=3.8`. That is, you should be able to launch `python3` from the terminal.

# Playlists Overview

The Playlists in this repo are supposed to present bite-sized exercises.

## Exercise structure

Before you take your first few steps it's important to set our expectations:

* The exercises for each playlists are found in a folder. For example, under (PATH) you have (PATH) for exercises. The exercises are ordered so go through them according to the filename.
* In each exercise - you will have some code to complete.
* The **technical specifications** of what you need to achieve will be written as docstrings inside the **code itself**.
* At times, we would offer some _"Recommended References"_ that will help you solve each specific challenge. We encourage you to search online and dive deeper on your own!
* After you complete each exercise, it is highly recommended to review the corresponding solution in the (PATH) directory. For example - the solution for (PATH) is in (PATH). The solution will show you a way to approach the exercise that might be different than yours, and at times - provide additional pointers.

Have fun and good luck!
